Thank you for you looking at my project, my name is Daniel Medvedev. I am currently a student at the University of Colorado Boulder.
This project is in the master's branch please go ahead and check it out.

 QUICK RUN DOWN:
 This project takes in a large amount of data that is not sorted through and goes through each individual data set. 
 This includes bubble sorting, heap sorting, hash sorting, and more.
 These functions also include a clock that I created to time the system and see which sorting method came out faster.
